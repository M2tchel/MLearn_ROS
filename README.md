# MLearn_ROS
A project aiming at adding effective, unsupervised machine learning techniques to ROS robots, specifically the TurtleBot3!

To run the code please look to the main.py file, all PPO hyperparameters can be modified in the ppo_alg.py file!

This project required a substantial amount of research into all things machine learning, I've listed the links to the sites I learnt from below:
